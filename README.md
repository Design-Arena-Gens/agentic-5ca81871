# MD Siam Islam Messenger Bot Proposal

An interactive Next.js site demonstrating the Facebook Messenger automation we can launch for the **MD Siam Islam** page. The experience showcases the welcome journey, bilingual quick replies, menu structure, project timeline, and pricing in a format that is ready to deploy on Vercel.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to explore the live prototype.

## Available scripts

- `npm run dev` – start the development server
- `npm run build` – create a production build
- `npm run start` – serve the production build locally
- `npm run lint` – run ESLint (Next.js core web vitals rules)

## Tech stack

- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- React 18 with client-side interaction for the messenger simulator
- TypeScript with strict mode
- Custom CSS for a clean, bilingual interface

## Deployment

The project is optimised for Vercel. Run `npm run build` before deploying to ensure the production bundle completes without errors.
